## Deploy to **Heroku**

<img align="right" width="100px" height="auto" src="https://cdn.worldvectorlogo.com/logos/heroku.svg" alt="Heroku">

Heroku is a free hosting service for hosting small projects. Easy setup and deploy from the command line via _git_.

###### Pros

* Easy setup
* Free

###### Cons

* App has to sleep a couple of hours every day.
* "Powers down" after 30 mins of inactivity. Starts back up when you visit the site but it takes a few extra seconds. Can maybe be solved with [**Kaffeine**](http://kaffeine.herokuapp.com/)

### Install Heroku ( stay in the same folder where you did git clone )


1 . Clone this repo to anywhere on your computer.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/reach2arunprakash/json-server-heroku.git
```

2 . Change `db.json` to **your own content** according to the [`json-server example`](https://github.com/typicode/json-server#example) and then `commit` your changes to git. 

_this example will create `/posts` route , each resource will have `id`, `title` and `content`. `id` will auto increment!_
```json
{
  "posts":[
    {
      "id" : 0,
      "title": "First post!",
      "content" : "My first content!"
    }
  ]
}
```

4 . Create an account on <br/>[https://heroku.com](https://heroku.com)

5 . Install the Heroku CLI on your computer: <br/>[https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)

6 . Connect the Heroku CLI to your account by writing the following command in your terminal and follow the instructions on the command line:
```bash
heroku login
```

7 . Then create a remote heroku project, kinda like creating a git repository on GitHub. This will create a project on Heroku with a random name. If you want to name your app you have to supply your own name like `heroku create project-name`: replace <my-cool-jsonserver> with your own name eg: arun-cool-jsonserver
```bash
heroku create <my-cool-jsonserver>
```
8 . To add remote repo to heroku 
```bash
heroku git:remote -a <my-cool-jsonserver>

git remote -v
```
9 . Push your app to __Heroku__ (you will see a wall of code). Do this from your folder where you did git clone of this repo
```bash
git push heroku master
```

10 . Visit your newly create app by opening it via heroku:
```bash
heroku open
```

11 . For debugging if something went wrong:
```bash
heroku logs --tail
```

#### How it works

Heroku will look for a startup-script, this is by default `npm start` so make sure you have that in your `package.json` (assuming your script is called `server.js`):
```json
 "scripts": {
    "start" : "node server.js"
 }
```

You also have to make changes to the port, you can't hardcode a dev-port. But you can reference herokus port. So the code will have the following:
```js
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
```
